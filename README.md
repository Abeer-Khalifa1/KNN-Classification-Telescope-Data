# KNN Classification on Telescope Data

A comprehensive implementation of K-Nearest Neighbors algorithm from scratch and using Scikit-Learn for classifying gamma and hadron particles from telescope data.

## ðŸ“Š Project Overview

This project implements KNN classification with two approaches:
- **Manual Implementation**: Euclidean distance, neighbor selection, and majority voting implemented from scratch
- **Scikit-Learn Implementation**: Using the built-in KNeighborsClassifier

## ðŸŽ¯ Key Features

- Data balancing and preprocessing
- Manual KNN implementation with custom distance calculation
- Scikit-Learn KNN implementation for comparison
- Hyperparameter tuning for optimal k-value
- Comprehensive performance evaluation
- Visualization of accuracy trends
